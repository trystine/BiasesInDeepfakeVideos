## Abstract/Introduction

#### Deep fakes are the kind of AI-generated media for the artificial production, manipulation, and modification of data, wherein a person in an existing image or video is replaced with someone elseâ€™s likeness [8]. While the act of faking content is not new, DeepFakes leverages powerful techniques from machine learning and artificial intelligence to manipulate or generate visual and audio content with a high potential to deceive. Appli- cations of deep fakes are quite comprehensive; they are used in Education to deliver engaging content and sometimes can bring historical figures to life in the classroom. Further applications involve the usage of DeepFakes to create comedy or parody content in the entertainment business and arts. While there are many positive applications of DeepFakes, there are detrimental effects such as Corporate Level Frauds that use DeepFakes to create voice-overs of important people and call individuals in the pursuit of scam, Extorting Money from Businesses or Individuals, Fakes videos etc [7]. The main focus of the paper is to study the two types of biases in DeepFakes such as gender and fat-anti fat bias in the society. The dataset considered for our research is FaceForensics++ which is widely available on kaggle, it consists of 1000 original video sequences of people belonging to Arts and Entertainment industry that have been manipulated with four automated face manipulation methods: DeepFakes, Face2Face, FaceSwap and NeuralTextures. Considered 500 videos from the FaceSwap Deepfake generator. Few of the key biases were observed in the dataset are gender and race bias as the dataset is mainly composed of Caucasian subjects, with the majority being female Caucasians [9]. One of the research papers published by (Department of Computer Science) University of Southern California highlights the performance of the detectors on the racial distribution where the videos with Darker black males perform worse compared to the white Caucassian males [1]. While the paper covers the gender and racial bias in DeepFakes, exploration of fat anti-fat bias along with analyzing the reason behind the gender bias in such deepfake videos is done.
